        <h2>Summary of "Great Expectations"</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone</p>
        <div>
            <p>In this blog I will share with you the summary of "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens:</p>
            <p>"Great Expectations" is a novel that follows the life of a young boy named Pip as he grows from an impoverished orphan into a gentleman. The story begins with Pip living with his abusive sister and her kind-hearted husband, Joe Gargery, a blacksmith. Pip’s life changes dramatically when he encounters an escaped convict named Magwitch, whom he helps by providing food and a file to remove his shackles.</p>
            <p>Later, Pip is invited to the house of Miss Havisham, a wealthy but eccentric old woman who was jilted at the altar and has since lived in a decaying mansion, dressed in her wedding gown. There, Pip meets and falls in love with Estella, Miss Havisham's beautiful but cold-hearted ward. Despite Estella’s indifference, Pip dreams of becoming a gentleman to win her love.</p>
            <p>Unexpectedly, Pip receives a large fortune from a secret benefactor, who he believes to be Miss Havisham. With this money, he moves to London, where he begins to learn the ways of a gentleman under the guidance of Mr. Jaggers, a lawyer. However, Pip soon discovers that his benefactor is actually Magwitch, the convict he helped as a child, who has amassed a fortune in Australia and wishes to repay Pip for his kindness.</p>
            <p>As the story progresses, Pip grapples with his conscience, social expectations, and his love for Estella. He learns harsh lessons about loyalty, affection, and the true nature of gentility. In the end, Pip comes to understand that wealth and status do not bring happiness, and he reconciles with Joe and Biddy, Joe’s new wife, who had always cared for him.</p>
            <p>The novel concludes with Pip returning to England after several years, having worked hard to repay his debts. He meets Estella once again, who has also suffered through life. The ending varies depending on the edition; in some versions, Pip and Estella walk away together as friends, while in others, their future remains uncertain.</p>
            <p>"Great Expectations" explores themes of social class, ambition, and the innocence of youth, and is considered one of Dickens’s greatest works.</p>
